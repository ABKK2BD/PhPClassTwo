Case Study:

	I have three old hp monitors, not new. I want to sell it on my own website. That’s why I should create a product upload form on my website, then upload my product with specification and available quantity. My monitors have a 15.6 inch display. My monitor’s VGA cable status, yes, I will sell it for 8000 tk.

$product_size = 15.6 ; // datatype is  float
